    "The GPT-2 model is one of the earlier large language models that was developed by OpenAI in 2019 and was released with an open source license. Compared to current models it is a relatively small model with the largest version containing 1.5 billion parameters en the smallest 124 million parameters. The model is available through the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2) and the transformers library. We use the example code from the Hugging Face model card to download the smallest version and complete text: "
